## Installation

Open the file terminal within the databse folder and connect to the database using "psql -U postgres". Insert your password to connect to your account. Then type "\i schema.sql" to initiate the employee_db database on your system. If you want some "test dummy" information, you can then type "\i seeds.sql" to have some automated users to test with. Then, navigate to another terminal within the "/Main" folder and type "npm run build" to compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript.

## Usage

Open a terminal within the "/Main" folder after installation and type "npm run start" to initialize the CLI (Command Line Interface).
